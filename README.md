# Image Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to build, train, and evaluate different CNN architectures to classify images into multiple categories. The project utilizes Python and various libraries, including TensorFlow and Keras, to implement the models and perform data manipulation.

## Project Description

The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Fetching the dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
2. **Data Exploration**: Analyzing the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
3. **Model Development**: Creating and experimenting with multiple CNN architectures.
4. **Training**: Training the models on the training dataset while monitoring performance.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using validation and test datasets.

## Theoretical Background

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models specifically designed for processing structured grid data such as images. They consist of convolutional layers that automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from images. Key concepts include:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Apply filters to input data to create feature maps.
- **Activation Functions**: Introduce non-linearity into the model. Common functions include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.
- **Dropout**: A regularization technique that randomly drops units during training to prevent overfitting.
- **Regularization**: Techniques that penalize complex models to improve generalization.
- **Optimizers**: Algorithms that update model weights based on computed gradients, with Adam and SGD being popular choices.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you need the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

## Data Preparation

1. **Fetching Data**: The dataset was fetched from Kaggle using the Kaggle API, which allows seamless integration with Google Colab for temporary storage.

2. **Exploration**: The dataset consists of images with three color channels and eight classes. The images vary in size, which necessitated resizing for uniformity.

3. **Splitting the Data**: The dataset was programmatically divided into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

## Model Architecture

The project experimented with six different CNN architectures, each varying in complexity and configurations:

- **Model 1**: Simple architecture with minimal layers, prone to overfitting.
- **Model 2**: Increased complexity with altered activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh).
- **Model 3**: Maintained complexity but introduced dropout layers (25% and 50%).
- **Model 4**: Removed dropout and applied regularization.
- **Model 5**: Adjusted optimizers to compare performance (SGD vs. Adam).

## Training and Evaluation

Each model was trained for 15 epochs, monitoring loss and F1 score. The performance was visualized using plots to assess the impact of architectural changes on model training and validation.

- **Loss and F1 Score**: Captured and plotted against epochs to visualize performance trends.
- **Overfitting**: Observed particularly in simpler models, leading to adjustments in architecture and regularization techniques.

## Results

The experiments revealed the following insights:

- **Best Performance**: Model 2, with increased complexity and appropriate activation functions, yielded the best results across training, validation, and convergence metrics.
- **Dropout Impact**: A 25% dropout rate improved generalization, while 50% dropout significantly hindered performance.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated the process of building and evaluating CNNs for image classification. The iterative experimentation with various architectures and techniques provided valuable insights into model performance and optimization strategies. Future work could explore more advanced architectures, such as transfer learning with pre-trained models, to further enhance classification accuracy.
